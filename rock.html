            <h2>Rock</h2>
            <p>Rock music is a dynamic and diverse genre that emerged in the mid-20th century, characterized by its strong emphasis on electric guitars, drums, and vocals. Rooted in various musical traditions such as blues, folk, and rhythm and blues, rock music has evolved into countless subgenres, each with its own unique sound and style. <br>
                <br>
                At its core, rock music is known for its driving rhythm, powerful instrumentation, and often rebellious attitude. The electric guitar plays a central role, delivering iconic riffs, solos, and melodies that define many classic rock songs. The drums provide a solid backbone, driving the music forward with energetic beats and fills, while the vocals, whether gritty and raw or melodic and emotive, convey the message and emotion of the song.<br>
                <br>
                One of the defining characteristics of rock music is its versatility. From the raw, visceral energy of early rock 'n' roll pioneers like Chuck Berry and Little Richard to the intricate arrangements and introspective lyrics of progressive rock bands like Pink Floyd and Yes, the genre encompasses a wide range of sounds and themes. Other notable subgenres include punk rock, with its fast-paced, DIY ethos; heavy metal, characterized by its aggressive guitar riffs and thunderous drums; and alternative rock, which embraces experimentation and innovation.<br>
                <br>
                Beyond its musical characteristics, rock music often serves as a platform for social commentary and cultural critique. Throughout its history, rock musicians have tackled issues such as politics, identity, and societal norms, using their music as a vehicle for expression and change.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to its cultural impact, rock music has also left an indelible mark on popular culture, influencing fashion, art, and lifestyle. From iconic album covers to legendary live performances, rock music continues to captivate audiences around the world, transcending generations and leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most influential genres in modern music.</p>
            <h2>The Beatles</h2>
                <p>Formed in Liverpool in 1960, The Beatles—comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—rose to fame during the 1960s and became one of the most influential bands in the history of popular music. Their innovative songwriting, experimental studio techniques, and infectious melodies revolutionized the music industry and inspired countless musicians across generations.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Beatles' discography spans a wide range of styles, from the early rock 'n' roll sound of "Please Please Me" to the psychedelic experimentation of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and the introspective maturity of "Abbey Road." Their impact on rock music extends far beyond their own era, influencing generations of artists and shaping the direction of popular music for decades to come.<br>
                    <br>
                    With their groundbreaking music, cultural influence, and enduring legacy, The Beatles stand as an iconic representation of the rock music genre.</p>
