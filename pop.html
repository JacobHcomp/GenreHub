            <h2>Pop</h2>
            <p>Pop music, short for "popular music," is a genre characterized by its wide appeal to a mainstream audience. Rooted in various musical traditions such as rock, R&B, hip-hop, and electronic dance music, pop music is known for its catchy melodies, simple song structures, and relatable lyrics. It often emphasizes memorable hooks, polished production, and easy-to-digest themes.<br>
                <br>
                One of the defining features of pop music is its accessibility. Pop songs are typically designed to be easily enjoyed and understood by a broad audience, with lyrics that touch on universal themes such as love, relationships, and self-expression. This universal appeal has helped pop music become one of the most commercially successful genres in the music industry.<br>
                <br>
                Pop music is constantly evolving, reflecting changes in popular culture, technology, and musical trends. From the bubblegum pop of the 1960s to the synth-driven sounds of the 1980s and the electronic beats of the 21st century, pop music encompasses a wide range of styles and influences.<br>
                <br>
                While pop music often draws criticism for its perceived lack of depth or artistic merit, it has also produced some of the most iconic and enduring songs in music history. Artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Beyonc√© have transcended the genre to become cultural icons, shaping not only the sound of pop music but also its visual and performance aspects.<br>
                <br>
                In addition to its commercial success, pop music has also played a significant role in shaping societal attitudes and cultural norms. Through its lyrics, imagery, and influence on popular culture, pop music has the power to spark conversations, challenge perceptions, and unite people from diverse backgrounds.<br>
                <br>
                Overall, pop music is a vibrant and ever-changing genre that continues to captivate audiences around the world with its infectious melodies, relatable lyrics, and universal appeal.</p>

                <p>Born in 1958, Jackson began his career as a child performer with the Jackson 5, alongside his siblings. However, it was his solo career that truly solidified his status as a pop music icon. With his unparalleled vocal talent, electrifying stage presence, and innovative dance moves, Jackson captivated audiences worldwide.<br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the 1980s, Jackson released a string of critically acclaimed albums, including "Off the Wall," "Thriller," and "Bad," which produced numerous chart-topping hits and shattered records. Songs like "Billie Jean," "Beat It," and "Thriller" not only topped the charts but also became cultural phenomena, defining the sound and style of the decade.<br>

                    <br>
                    Moreover, Jackson's influence transcended musical boundaries, as he used his platform to address social issues and promote messages of unity, love, and empowerment.
